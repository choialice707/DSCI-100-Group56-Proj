    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " Wine is a complex beverage composed of numerous compounds that contribute to its overall quality and taste. It is viewed as a luxury good and it is enjoyed by many consumers all over the world. The beverage's quality is most commonly assessed through both physicochemical properties and sensory tests (Mor et al.), we used this vital piece of information as the basis for our project. In this data science project, we will determine the most influential physicochemical compounds within wine to most accurately predict overall wine quality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Through data analysis, we hope to find predictive relationships in certain compounds that make up wine in hopes of answering our project’s primary question: \n",
    " **How accurately can we predict the quality of wine with the most relevant physicochemical elements using the K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm?**\n",
    "\n",
    " We will use a 2009 “Wine Quality” dataset from Portugal which models several different red wines based on physicochemical tests and their quality from sensory data as a score between 0 and 10. Portugal is one of the top 10 countries that export wine, for which the wine industry is investing in technologies for winemaking and selling. For this dataset, wine certification and quality assessment are key elements. \n",
    " These are the columns of the dataset.\n",
    " \n",
    "* 1 - fixed acidity\n",
    "* 2 - volatile acidity\n",
    "* 3 - citric acid\n",
    "* 4 - residual sugar\n",
    "* 5 - chlorides\n",
    "* 6 - free sulfur dioxide\n",
    "* 7 - total sulfur dioxide\n",
    "* 8 - density\n",
    "* 9 - pH\n",
    "* 10 - sulphates\n",
    "* 11 - alcohol\n",
    "* Output variable (based on sensory data): \n",
    "* 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)\n",

    " Here the data used was scaled to ensure clear visualizations and facilitate effective comparison of variables since the distances between the points would have otherwise have different significances for the y and x axis . Scaling was performed using standardization, which standardized the range and distribution of the physicochemical elements. This process allowed for a fair and meaningful visual analysis, ensuring that variables with different scales did not dominate the visualizations. As a result, scaling the data improved the clarity and interpretability of the visual comparisons, aiding in the assessment of relationships between the physicochemical elements and wine quality."
